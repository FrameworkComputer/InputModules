This is a simple USB-C adapter to use and develop Input Modules outside
of a Framework Laptop 16.  Note that the actual pogo pin connector is a 
custom Framework part.  We're working through how to make these available
to developers more broadly.

## Assembly and Fabrication
We recommend using a 0.8mm PCB for this due to the specific USB-C connector
we selected (for hand-solderability).  To make Input Modules attach to the
adapter, you can glue in 5mm x 2mm cylindrical magnets or glue on
5mm x 5mm x 1.2mm square magnets.  You can use 6mm M2 fasteners as the 
alignment pins.
